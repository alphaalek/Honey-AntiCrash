#
# This is the configuration file for the AntiCrash plugin Honey made by Alek.
#   + You are currently using the version 2.3.2
#   + One of the best Anti-Netty Crashers / Anti-Exploit plugins out there, and constantly evolving!
#
# Note! If you discover any errors or bugs, write to me on the discord server. (see below)
#
# Also remember, that false flags can occur, so it is not recommended to ban a player just after
# some few violations shown in chat. (it can sometimes emerge at serverside or clientside lagspikes)
# That is exactly what this file is for. You should change the values you can see below if that's
# what your server need. Everything is configurable, and every server is different. That's why
# you have to set it up to match your server! If you have trouble doing this, I will gladly help you. :-)

# you have to join the discord server to prove you have bought the plugin.
